* The typograpfy was imported from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and pasted in style.css file. 
* For the headings i use [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?query=bebas+neue) (Regular 400), with a fallback of Sans-Serif.
* For the paragraphs and links i use [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) (Light 300),  with a fallback of Sans-Serif.
