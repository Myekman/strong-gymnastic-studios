## Typography


* The typograpfy was imported from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and pasted in style.css file. 
* For the headings i use [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?query=bebas+neue) (Regular 400), with a fallback of Sans-Serif.
* For the paragraphs and links i use [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) (Light 300),  with a fallback of Sans-Serif. 

## Images 

*I chose the images for the clean feel. As they look clean and contain few colors them are easy to match with the rest of the design.
* Size og images are customized to fit the rest of the page structure.
